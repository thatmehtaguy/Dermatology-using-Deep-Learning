# Dermatology-using-Deep-Learning

Skin diseases are a major public health problem in India, with a high prevalence of conditions such as leprosy, dermatitis, and skin cancers. Early and accurate diagnosis of skin diseases is essential for effective treatment and management, particularly in resource-limited settings where access to specialized medical care may be limited. Machine learning techniques have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of skin disease diagnosis in India by automating the process of identifying and classifying skin lesions. The use of machine learning for skin disease detection is a timely and important topic for India as it has the potential to significantly impact the field of dermatology and improve patient care in the country. Additionally, the development and implementation of machine learning-based systems for skin disease detection could potentially lead to cost savings for the healthcareÂ system.
